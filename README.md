# JavaScript Variables

## Description

This is the third exercise in the Wes Bos JavaScript 30 challenge. The challenge was to use variables to adjust the border size, blur effect, and colors on the page.

- My motivation was to continue to build my skillset
- This exercise was interesting because it accounted for realtime changes rather than just updating the value once.
- The biggest challenge I faced was that the realtime functionality for the color changes doesn't work in all browsers. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting my code and discovered that the type of cursor used to select colors doesn't register mouse change in Chrome.

## Usage

There are two sliders and a color picker that can be adjusted. Spacing changes the thickness of the border around the image. Blur adjusts the intensity of the blur effect on the image. Base color changes the border and part of the title.
